# README
Autobot Code Challenge
======================
Task is in task.md file.

# Solution
To run the test:

1. Clone the repo.
2. Make sure Ruby is installed.
3. $bundle install # to install required gems( only 2 are used Rspec for Unit testing and Rake as build utility )
4. You can run both tasks separately:  
    $rake run_first_task  
    $rake run_second_task
    
   You can run both tasks together:  
    $rake run_both_tasks
5. Have fun!
